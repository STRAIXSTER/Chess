In this branch I am testing each piece's individual move.

This version only focuses on the player's pieces. The AI is still inactive.

All the player's pieces work (with some flaws, like, the fact that all the pieces can jump over others , even if they are not a knight).

I'm gonna try to fix these flaws after I am done with the AI.
